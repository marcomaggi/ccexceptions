Subject: [announce] CCExceptions revision 0.6.4-devel.0

			      CCExceptions
			      ============


This package installs a standard  C11 language library; it implements an
interface to  non-local exits, which  is somewhat similar  to exceptions
handling.  The library targets POSIX systems.

  The package  makes use  of the  GNU Autotools  and it  is tested  on a
GNU+Linux system.  It is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public
License version 3.0.

  The latest release of this package can be downloaded from:

       <https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/ccexceptions/downloads>

development takes place at:

	      <http://github.com/marcomaggi/ccexceptions/>

and as backup at:

	    <https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/ccexceptions/>

the documentation is available online:

Notes for revision 0.6.4-devel.0
--------------------------------

* Added API for guarded malloc invocation:

    cce_sys_malloc_guarded_cleanup
    cce_sys_malloc_guarded_error
    cce_sys_malloc_guarded


Notes for revision 0.6.3-devel.0
--------------------------------

* Added new condition object type: unreachable code.


Notes for revision 0.6.2-devel.3
--------------------------------

* Fixed wrong names for malloc handlers.  In the source code it was wrongly:

    cce_sys_error_handler_malloc_init()
    cce_sys_error_handler_malloc_init()

  instead of the correct:

    cce_error_handler_malloc_init()
    cce_error_handler_malloc_init()

* Added some examples under the "examples" directory of the source tree.

* Fixed tests handling asynchronous resources incorrectly.

* Fixed   parent  type   of  "cce_condition_invalid_argument_t"   to  be
  "cce_condition_logic_error_t".

* Fixed    parent     type    of    "cce_condition_errno_t"     to    be
  "cce_condition_runtime_error_t".

* Fixed   parent   type   of   "cce_condition_unimplemented_t"   to   be
  "cce_condition_logic_error_t".

Notes for revision 0.6.2-devel.2
--------------------------------

* Removed some useless condition object finalisation functions.

Notes for revision 0.6.2-devel.1
--------------------------------

* Added function "cce_condition_init_root()".

* More documentation for the "root" condition type.

Notes for revision 0.6.2-devel.0
--------------------------------

* Added initialiser and finaliser functions for some condition objects.

Notes for revision 0.6.0-devel.1
--------------------------------

* Review of function attributes in the public header file.

Notes for revision 0.6.0-devel.0
--------------------------------

* Removed all the system adapter functions  that are now in a standalone
  package: CCSys.


Notes for revision 0.5.0-devel.2
--------------------------------

* The library language is now standard C11.

* Dropped support for some system functions deprecated by POSIX.


Notes for revision 0.3d0
------------------------

* Changed the type definitions  for "cce_location_t" and "cce_handler_t"
  to favour uniformity.  This is a backwards incompatible change.


Notes for revision 0.2d0

  by "-fplan9-extensions".
